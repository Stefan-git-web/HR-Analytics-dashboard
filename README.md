### 5Ô∏è‚É£ DAX Measures
**KPIs**
```DAX
Count of Employees = COUNTROWS(Employees)

Attrition = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Employees), Employees[Attrition] = "Yes")

Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Attrition], [Count of Employees], 0)

Avg Age = AVERAGE(Employees[Age])

Avg Salary = AVERAGE(Employees[MonthlyIncome])

Avg Years = AVERAGE(Employees[YearsAtCompany])

# Attrition by Category
Attrition Count = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Employees), Employees[Attrition] = "Yes")
Attrition % by Field = DIVIDE([Attrition Count], CALCULATE([Attrition Count], ALL(Employees[EducationField])), 0)

### Feedback Total
Total Feedback = SUM(Employees[Feedback])
